#labels HTML5,Featured,File
With HTML5 just round the corner, some new features are going to be added to AWSOMEcms, or... already are.

Currently there is a lot of work done in order to support file drag-and-drop upload, which makes uploading multiple files as easy as it can get.

Some major changes are a re factoring of the admin tree, which is no longer a data structure on the server site, but now is client side. This means it is a lot more dynamic and can support changes in the tree without reloading the page.

Further more there is a new component, the File component, which will act as a central repository for all uploaded files. This means components will no longer need to support their own file upload but can just add a file select field and get a reference to an image. This not only organizes the files but has a lot more re-use value. (Slideshow and gallery both has the same stuff)

These two major features are at the base of the file drag-and-drop system that is not implemented. However it is still Firefox 3.6+ only. Since there is still a lot of work being done on the HTML5 APIs (including he file API), the other browsers are not yet supported. As soon as there is a way though, these will be added.

Anyways, for those that get a clean install; The admintree is divided into two sections now, the Siteroot and the Contentroot. Siteroot are visible pages, where Contentroot are static content like uploaded files.
